                In this website, you can discover what your favorite ingrediants make when combined.
                An interactive map showing where to find the best enemies to defeat and a description of what you are walking into.
                <!-- Finally, an interactive map to discover where to find the best armor sets and what makes them so useful.  -->
                We understand that this is barebones but we are on a time constraint so we need to keep this within reason of new developers.

            As gamers ourselves, we were also in a position where we walked out of that cave for the first time, and had no clue what to do.
            All we could do was progress and figure things out as we go.
            The whole purpose of this website is to help new players understand the virtual world of Hyrule.
            So they can fully enjoy it with some of the confusion alleviated.
