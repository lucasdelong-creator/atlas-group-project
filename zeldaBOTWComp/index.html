                In this website, we have decided to make a few pages to understand enemies, get the most out of your buffs and introduce you to characters within Hyrule.
                Within these pages, we go into detail abou these subjects to ensure you come out with a better understanding of the game.  
                We understand that this is barebones but we are on a time constraint so we need to keep this within reason of new developers.

            As gamers ourselves, we were also in a position where we walked out of that cave for the first time, and had no clue what to do.
            All we could do was progress and figure things out as we go.
            The whole purpose of this website is to help new players understand the virtual world of Hyrule.
            So they can fully enjoy it with some of the confusion alleviated.
